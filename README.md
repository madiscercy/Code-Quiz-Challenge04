# Code Quiz Challenge
##By Madison Scercy
This project is a coding quiz. You will see the start page with the ability to go ahead and view highscores, and clicking the start button will start the game. You will see the questions pop up and choosing the wrong answer will deduct 5 seconds from the timer. After all questions have been answered, it will take you to the end page where it displays your score and allows you to enter your initials. Entering your initials will take you to the highscore page, where it shows highscores in order from highest to lowest. At that, you can press the go back button to bring you to the beginning where you can restart the quiz! special thanks to Andres Jimenez for the help with javascript on this project.
